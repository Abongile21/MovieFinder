Good morning Group A.

Code & Project Review
Good job on the User Interface, I believe you are fixing the navigation of the app as I currently don't have access to other pages

Suggestion#1: refrain from using magic strings which is a "direct usage of a String in the code", e.g in the fetch(), it would be better to declare a variable called URL and instantiate it with the url link then add it as a parameter in the fetch, rather than fetch("abcc"). 

Suggestion#2: It's always good to give users some light on how to use your application so how about you have a list of maybe 5 movies on the landing page and then the user can then search for more

Note:
Line 37 on index.html contains closing div tag, no opening tag
